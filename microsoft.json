How would you find the head of the cycle i.e. where the cycle starts? How would you find the kth element from the end of a linked list? Then about 2 weeks later I got an invitation for interviews on-site and about 3 weeks after that I flew out to Redmond. I had 4 interviews on-site which had behavioral questions and also coding questions like: How would you test a phone (your simple 20 year old phone)? Give test cases for some functions whose implementation is not know i.e. blackbox testing. The people there were great and I really liked their campus.",

        "details": "I would like to start out by saying this has been by far been the worst, most poorly handled, and longest (by a long shot) interview experience I've ever had to deal with.It started out with a phone screen, the developer over the phone made me excited for the team I wanted to interview for. The talk was great. I moved onto the onsite after getting the news I did well over the phone and giving my initial recruiter total compensation expectancies as well as additional information.The onsite went really well. All of the members of the team that I interviewed with, as well as other developers in the org, made me really want to come work there. Most of them seemed excited about their work and they all seemed like people I would want to work with.Waiting to hear back took a couple of long weeks. I had no insight into what was going on behind the scenes. Some time later I received a phone call from my first (yes, first and honestly it may have been the second) recruiter saying that I \"needed\" to come in... onsite, and have another interview with a different hiring manager for a different team. I took another day off and did that.This mainly consisted of telling me that my interview feedback was good, and that they would have openings in the near future and that they would want to extend an offer at that point, but I just needed to hold out and wait. He explained the team, which was something even more in my wheel house, which made me even more excited, this time knowing for sure that I would have an offer coming my way.Another couple of weeks later, I receive an email from yet another new recruiter who didn't have any of the original information I had previously given my last recruiter. She wasn't even completely up to date on what teams I had interviewed with or what my story was. No big deal, I gave her all of the information, but clearly no communication from internal recruiters.Eventually I was made an offer. In my opinion, knowing what other developers were being offered, it was a really low ball offer. I had explained I would actually be losing money with the offer they made me. The recruiter took the offer back to the hiring manager with my comments and a few days later contacted me saying she wanted to talk again about my offer.She was very blunt when we finally got on the phone. She explained what she thinks she would have been able to do for me compensation wise, but said she had bad news. She told me they lost the head count and would be pulling the offer off the table, and that she was sorry.I have since tried to contact my recruiter to see if their is possibly other teams within the org that could use my positive interview feedback for a hire, but she is no longer responding.Ultimately, it's time to move on. This experience has made me question why I was even excited to work at Microsoft in the first place. If this is how awful the recruiting/budgeting and hiring process is, it makes me wonder what else is like this internally at Microsoft. All in all, just a terrible experience where I was a hot potato with very little insight and clarity into what was actually happening after being told I would receive an offer.For what it's worth, Microsoft isn't actually offering as much as some other smaller companies. If money is something that is important to you, you'll be better off not dealing with this and looking elsewhere.",

The 60 minute online test which I took was stressed to be 3 questions, but instead had 5. The first three were all of the same question form (what is wrong with this code and fix it), but in different languages. It was clear to me these were standins for eachother, and you could choose which one to solve, as the test was only to be 3 questions in 60 minutes, not 5 questions. It would be absurd to have to finish all three of these (c++,typescript,react), especially as the test was also stressed to be language agnostic. Why am I even forced to a language type for these questions in the first place if the exam is language agnostic?In addition, the test did not actually state that one did or did not have to complete all 3 of these quasi-duplicates, which means I had no way to tell whether this was a poorly stated 3 question exam, or a terribly constructed 5 question exam with an absurd timelimit. I was told I did not answer some questions, of which I did not answer the duplicates of course, and was not passed. Did the person grading it not know it was a 3 question exam? How is that even possible, unless the person was not informed on how to grade the exam properly? Do the people collectively managing this hiring process communicate together about the process itself? On communicating all of these concerns, I have received no feedback, and the recruiter has seemingly ceased communications. How ironic.Red. Flags.So many red flags.This is a major failure on their part, and I cannot support or take part in this process, so I will not be re-applying to Microsoft for any position.**And in addition to all these issues, the recruiter invited me to an event previously, which I prepared for... but since she invited me to a second event as well, the initial invitation was no longer on the table, which I was not ever informed of. It turns out there is a process of technical screening beforehand, which I was never informed or updated about. So I scheduled for a day at their campus, and that was a bit poor on their part, too.",

        "details": "Phone call after applying. Quick behavioral questions. Final question about 9 marbles, 1 heavier than all of them, find it using a 2 plate scale.Get an email inviting me to fly out a month later. They set you up with a nice hotel in Bellvue, WA and a rental car (if chosen). Pay for all your meals - an allowance of $75 a day or something in that area. Day of the interview comes, they pick candidates up together in a party bus infront of the hotel. The bus had flashing strobe lights and neon green lighting at 7am in the morning. It was funny if anything, but quite silly.Throughout the whole thing, I never get told what I was interviewing for. They finally told us and I was COMPLETELY uninterested in the team. That spiked my confidence down. I could've saved MS $2,000+ for my trip if they told me that upfront, I would've declined. Even after talking to all the interviewers, it clearly wasn't for me. So how they got that from my resume I'm not sure.But, that doesn't mean I didn't give it my best shot. Four 45 minute interviews with 5 minute breaks in between for food/drink. The atmosphere was wonderful. It was a great confidence booster. I felt awesome and confident I could nail the position anyway, and after the first interviewer I was told that mobility was a nice perk of the job without even asking! The interviewers started with questions about me, my past projects, strengths/weaknesses, technical questions next, and left maybe a minute or two for questions about them.Technical questions were:-Implement circular array with a k-step elimination-Return sub-array with a maximum continuous sum-Check for a tic-tac-toe winner given a matrix-Without knowing the size of an array, find an element.Strongest interview I think I've ever had. Yet I was told 2 work-days after leaving that they passed on me. I think I fell short on the last interview, with the element in the array, because I didn't realize try-catch was an option to use in a interview. My previous work experience does NOT use try-catch loops, that's a big no-no, they're super slow. I've always used assertions. I got halfway through the question before that and he was unhelpful in pointing out options to solve the problem. He was also a very off-putting interviewer, and didn't seem organized.The other 3 interviewers I had - we laughed, we discussed interesting topics like AI/machine-learning, I nailed the technical questions from start to finish with room for testing and optimization, it was a great time. So my best guess is that last guy talked bad of me, and I was told you need all 4 to basically love you to get in. Waste of time, waste of money on their part.Summary - super easy interviews with laid back atmosphere, great hospitality, but you're left in the dark with what you're interviewing for until the day of and all it takes is 1 interviewer to be stubborn and unreasonable.",

All expense paid trip to Redmond. Flew me in, stayed 3 days 2 nights in a sweet hotel, rental car, fancy meals, the works.The on site interview was with 4 engineers from the same team. 45 minute interviews with each one. Most of them were simple conversations. If you make it to this round it's basically a culture fit. They didn't ask a single code question and none of those stupid \"How many golf balls fit in a school bus\" type questions. The whole team was really good. Less than a week later the recruiter contacted me with an offer. They're looking for people that love what they do and love to learn and grow on their own.
